### What I learned

This is an old coded project, but here's what i learnt earlier in the past while coding it.

- I learnt how to use JSON in my javascript code and also how to parse / **("unstring")** it in other to turn a json file to an object.

- I learnt how to find the max number of an **array-object** i.e the *unstringed* json file

### Continued development

I will continue to focus on the use of json file and how to import it with **Async and Await** type programming
